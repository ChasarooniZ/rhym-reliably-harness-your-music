# RHYM: Reliably Harness Your Music

Currently a WIP module, releasing a basic version of one of the features of the module just to start. More features to follow at some point.

### Combat Music Management

- When combat is created it does the following
- Opens a dialog with a list of all Combat playlists (ones that use the prefix set in settings)
  - If you **Left Click** a playlist you can set it as the active playing playlist
  - If you **Right Click** a playlist you can change the icon
- IF a Preparations playlist is set, it Will play it when a combat is created, until you select a separate playlist
